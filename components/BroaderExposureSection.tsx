        Check If Your Number Has Wider Digital Exposure

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-base">
        If you responded to a WhatsApp scam message, clicked a suspicious link,
        or shared your phone number with an unknown contact, your details may
        circulate beyond that single conversation.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-base">
        Scam operations frequently distribute collected phone numbers across
        spam networks, phishing lists, and fraudulent messaging campaigns.
        Blocking the original sender does not always stop further targeting.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-base">
        In some cases, exposed numbers are reused in impersonation attempts,
        fake banking alerts, delivery scams, investment fraud schemes, or
        identity-based phishing campaigns targeting South African users.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-base">
        Understanding whether your number may be part of broader exposure
        patterns allows you to monitor unusual activity, strengthen your
        account security settings, and reduce the likelihood of repeat scams.
